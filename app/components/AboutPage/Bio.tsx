        Hello! My name is Abdelrahman, I&apos;m a Front-end developer from Egypt. I
        started out my career in tech as a technical support specialist,
        assisting customers with technical queries among other things.
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        I then got interested in switching careers to software development after
        which I started out as a Data Analyst for a call center company where I
        managed call ques and generated reports for clients using Python, numpy
        and pandas.
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        After a year of working as a Data Analyst I got curious about other
        opportunities in tech that I can work in, which put me on the way to Web
        Development, since part of my job as a data analyst was generating
        reports using excel; I went ahead and automated the data extraction and
        presentation processes using a popular dashboard library called{" "}
        <i>streamlit</i>
      </p>
      <p className="my-8">
        I quickly fell in love with Python and the power it gave me, I ended up
        automating 80% of my job! I then used TheOdinProject online curriculum
        and several youtube channels to start my journey in Web Development.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        I got my first job away from freelancing at a company called{" "}
        <i>Scandiweb</i>. I had to learn PHP as part of on-job training while
        the interview tested my React and javascript knowledge, I managed to
        learn all the essentials for the job in around 3 weeks, PHP was my third
        language to learn after Javascript and Python.
